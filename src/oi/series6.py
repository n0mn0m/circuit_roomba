    Baud: 115200 or 19200 (see below) Data bits: 8
    Parity: None
    Stop bits: 1
    Flow control: None
    By default, Roomba communicates at 115200 baud. If you are using a microcontroller that does not
    support 115200 baud, there are two ways to force Roomba to switch to 19200:

    Method 1:
    While powering off Roomba, continue to hold down the Clean/Power button after the light has turned off.
    After about 10 seconds, Roomba plays a tune of descending pitches. Roomba will communicate at 19200 baud
    until the processor loses battery power or the baud rate is explicitly changed by way of the OI.

    Method 2:
    Use the Baud Rate Change pin (pin 5 on the Mini-DIN connector) to change Roombaâ€™s baud rate.
    After turning on Roomba, wait 2 seconds and then pulse the Baud Rate Change low three times.
    Each pulse should last between 50 and 500 milliseconds. Roomba will communicate at 19200 baud until the
    processor loses battery power or the baud rate is explicitly changed by way of the OI.
